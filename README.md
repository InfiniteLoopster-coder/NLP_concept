# NLP & GenAI Mastery Roadmap

This repository provides a comprehensive roadmap to master Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts, from foundational linguistic theory to building agentic systems with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Use this as your guide for learning and project implementation.

## 1. Foundations of Language & Text
**Goal:** Understand what makes human language tick, and the challenges for a machine.

- **Linguistic Levels**
  - Phonology & Morphology (sounds & word structure)
  - Syntax (sentence structure)
  - Semantics (meaning)
  - Pragmatics (contextual use)

- **Key Challenges**
  - Ambiguity, synonymy, polysemy
  - Idioms, out‑of‑vocabulary words

## 2. Text Preprocessing & Representations
**Goal:** Learn how to turn raw text into numbers.

- **Tokenization**: word‑, subword‑ (BPE/WordPiece), character
- **Normalization**: lowercasing, stemming vs. lemmatization, stop‑word removal

### Classic Representations
- Bag‑of‑Words / TF‑IDF
- N‑grams

### Dense Embeddings
- Word2Vec (CBOW & Skip‑Gram)
- GloVe
- FastText

## 3. Traditional NLP Algorithms
**Goal:** Build intuition with rule‑ and probabilistic‑based methods.

- **Language Modeling**: n‑gram models, smoothing (Laplace, Kneser‑Ney)
- **Sequence Labeling**
  - Part‑of‑Speech tagging (HMMs, CRFs)
  - Named Entity Recognition
- **Parsing & Syntax**: dependency vs. constituency parsing

## 4. Introduction to Neural Networks for NLP
**Goal:** See why neural methods overtook classical approaches.

- Feed‑forward nets for classification
- Vanilla RNNs & their limitations (vanishing/exploding gradients)
- LSTM & GRU: gating mechanisms

## 5. Attention & the Transformer Architecture
**Goal:** Master the core innovation behind every modern LLM.

- **Attention Mechanism**: query/key/value, scaled dot‑product
- **Transformer**
  - Encoder/Decoder: multi‑head attention, positional encoding
- **Key Paper**: “Attention Is All You Need” (Vaswani et al., 2017)

## 6. Pretrained Language Models (PLMs)
**Goal:** Learn how massive unsupervised training gives powerful “foundation” models.

- **Encoder‑Only Models**: BERT, RoBERTa (masked LM + next sentence prediction)
- **Decoder‑Only Models**: GPT‑2/3/4 (autoregressive LM)
- **Encoder‑Decoder Models**: T5, BART (sequence‑to‑sequence)
- **Techniques**: Fine‑Tuning vs. Prompting vs. LoRA/Adapters

## 7. Evaluation & Practical Tooling
**Goal:** Get hands‑on with libraries and learn to measure performance.

- **Libraries**: Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, NLTK
- **Metrics**: Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, F₁, Exact Match
- **Datasets**: GLUE, SQuAD, CoNLL, WMT

## 8. Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)
**Goal:** Combine retrieval systems with LLMs for up‑to‑date, factual outputs.

- **Retrieval Basics**:
  - Inverted indices, BM25 (Elasticsearch)
  - Vector search: FAISS, Annoy, HNSW

- **Building a RAG Pipeline**:
  1. Document ingestion & embedding (e.g., sentence‑transformers)
  2. Vector store setup (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate…)
  3. Retriever + Reader pattern
  4. Prompt engineering to fuse retrieved context with generation

## 9. From RAG to Agentic Systems
**Goal:** Orchestrate multiple skills (search, QA, action) into a coherent agent.

- **Agent Frameworks**: LangChain, AutoGen, Haystack
- **Tool Use & Planning**: chain‑of‑thought, function‑calling APIs
- **Memory & State**: short‑term vs. long‑term memory modules
- **Safety & Guardrails**: retrieval filters, output validation

## 10. Capstone Project
**Goal:** Cement your learning by building a small end‑to‑end system.

**Example: “Customer Support Agent”**
- Retrieves relevant product docs
- Generates human‑like answers
- Logs conversation state
- Executes simple actions (e.g., ticket creation via API)

**Steps:**
1. Data collection & ingestion
2. Embedding & vector store setup
3. Fine‑tuning or prompt‑tweaking
4. Agent orchestration with LangChain
